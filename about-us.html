                <div class="prose prose-lg mx-auto">
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        After discovering that billions of dollars in unclaimed funds are held by state governments, 
                        we realized that many Americans are unaware of money that rightfully belongs to them. The 
                        process of searching multiple state databases can be overwhelming, and some people fall 
                        victim to services that charge unnecessary fees.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-6">
                        We created UnclaimedFundsFindr to simplify this process. Our platform provides easy access to 
                        official state unclaimed property offices and offers free reminders to help you stay 
                        informed about potential unclaimed funds.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our goal is simple: help reunite Americans with their unclaimed money through legitimate, 
                        official channels. No fees, no middlemen, just direct connections to the government 
                        agencies that hold these funds.

                        <p class="text-gray-600">
                            Through state databases, you can find various types of unclaimed property including forgotten bank accounts, uncashed checks, insurance payouts, security deposits, utility refunds, stocks, bonds, and contents from safe deposit boxes.

                            Processing times vary by state and claim complexity. Once you file a claim through your state's unclaimed property office, it typically takes 30-90 days to receive your funds. Some states may process claims more quickly or take longer.
